# Beach Blaze Bot Source Code

Beach Blaze is a Giveaways and Polls bot in one single bot. The bot has been created by the same people who made Shadow's Dark Network and SHADOW OS.EXE

## Setup

All you have to do is change "BOTTOKENHERE" with your own bot token and just run it and you are good to go.

To get a bot token, you will need to create a bot application

For Discord, head over to discord.com/developers and create a new application, then head over to the bot tab and enable the message content intent. To get your token, click "reset token" and you will get your new bot token. You can copy that and paste it into the main-discord.py file.

For Revolt, click "create a bot" and give it a name. You will see a token. click on the clipboard next to the token to copy the token to paste in the main-revolt.py file.
